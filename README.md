# Frontend Mentor Challenges Repository

Welcome to my Frontend Mentor Challenges repository! This repository houses all the challenges I have attempted from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). My goal is to improve and master my CSS and front-end development skills through practical projects.

## How This Repository Works

In this repository, each branch corresponds to a specific challenge from Frontend Mentor. The `master` branch is intentionally empty to keep the repository clean, and each challenge is isolated to its own branch. You can find and explore the challenges by switching between branches.

Here's a list of the challenges I have done so far:
